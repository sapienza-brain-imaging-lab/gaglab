# GagLab
A MATLAB toolbox for behavioral experiments based on Cogent 2000

The GagLab toolbox, developed at the Brain Imaging Laboratory, Sapienza University, is a MATLAB toolbox allowing to program behavioral and fMRI experiments with Cogent 2000 in an easy and device-independent way. Prepare the experiment on your laptop, test it with your keyboard, and run it without any modification in the MR scanner, with an optical button box and synced to fMRI acquisitions.
